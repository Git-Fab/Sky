The Gym at Sky have asked for a core KPI pack 
and self-serve data on performance to help them 
increase membership and reduce queue times at 
busy periods. 

Can you create a short presentation (max 3 slides) 
explaining how you would go about this activity, 
what data solution you propose the type of dashboard 
reports and how the gym team could self-serve.

+ Queues:  Waiting time/reserves list for classes
+ Queues: can't analyze queue times for machines - can only look at volumes of members in gym
	+ Define beforehand how queue times are defined - can they do anything to better measure queues
	+ Customer satisfaction surveys for members - actual survey vs NPS machines - feed this into dashboard
	+ Clarify that KPIs are only indicaters - not proxys necessarily
	+ Need to discuss with client beforehand what they want to try and measure
		+ Understand what they're asking for and whether or not the data is available to run those analyses
		+ Decide what analyses we data we have that can be used to define Queue time ongoing - do we ned to start collecting new data?

+ Clairfy you can drill down by time and demog combined
+ Start with final dashboard and drill down - flip order
